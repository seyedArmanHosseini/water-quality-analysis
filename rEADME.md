## Objective

To build a regression model that accurately predicts the **Water Quality Index (WQI)** using various chemical and physical properties of water samples.

## Models Used

- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor (best performing)  
- LightGBM Regressor (also tested)

## Methods

- Data Cleaning and Missing Value Imputation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Scaling  
- Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Evaluation Metrics: MAE, RMSE, RÂ² Score  
- SHAP Analysis for Interpretability

## Results

- XGBoost Regressor achieved the best performance.  
- Features like **Sulfate**, **Conductivity**, and **Organic Carbon** had the most influence on WQI predictions.
